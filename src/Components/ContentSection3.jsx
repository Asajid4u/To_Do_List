      <p className="indiap1">Historians consider India's modern age to have begun sometime between 1848 and 1885. The appointment in 1848 of Lord Dalhousie as Governor General <br />of the East India Company set the stage for changes essential to a modern state. These included the consolidation and demarcation of sovereignty, the <br />surveillance of the population, and the education of citizens. Technological changes—among them, railways, canals, and the telegraph—were introduced <br />not long after their introduction in Europe.[142][143][144][145] However, disaffection with the company also grew during this time and set off the Indian <br /> Rebellion of 1857. Fed by diverse resentments and perceptions, including invasive British-style social reforms, harsh land taxes, and summary treatment <br /> of some rich landowners and princes, the rebellion rocked many regions of northern and central India and shook the foundations of Company rule. <br /> Although the rebellion was suppressed by 1858, it led to the dissolution of the East India Company and the direct administration of India by the British <br /> government. Proclaiming a unitary state and a gradual but limited British-style parliamentary system, the new rulers also protected princes and landed <br /> gentry as a feudal safeguard against future unrest. In the decades following, public life gradually emerged all over India, leading eventually to <br />the founding of the Indian National Congress in 1885.[150][151][152][153]</p>
